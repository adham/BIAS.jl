# BIAS
Bayesian Inference At Scale

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adham/BIAS.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adham/BIAS.jl)


*BIAS* is an open source implementation of several Bayesian parametric and non-parametric
models in [julia](http://julialang.org/). The implemented models include:

1. Bayesian Mixture Model (BMM)
2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
3. Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPM)
4. Hierarchical Dielectric Mixture Model (HDP)
5. dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Model (dHDP)
6. Temporal Dirichlet Process Mixture model (TDPM) also called Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process (RCRP)
7. Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Franchise (RCRF)

See the [Package Documentation](http://biasjl.readthedocs.org) for details and examples.
